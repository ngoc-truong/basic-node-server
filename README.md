# Basic node.js server

In this practice project, I created a simple node.js server which serves the correct 
page according to the url.

- localhost:3000 should serve index.html
- localhost:3000/about should serve about.html
- localhost:3000/contact-me should serve contanct.html
- 404.html should be displayed any time the user tries to go to a page which was not found
